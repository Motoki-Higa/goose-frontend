# goose-frontend

An SNS like app for bike lovers.
*This repo is only for the frontend

## Live on Netlify

Hey there! Thanks for visiting my app "Goose".  
This app is open to public, so you can signup and look around the app.

__NOTE:__
As this app is still in the development process, the front-end (react) and the back-end (express) are hosted on the free services such as Netlify and Heroku, so you might get slower server response for loading pages and posting stuff.  
Also, __you might get the signup confirmation email in your trash box__, as it will be sent by gmail (motonx.dev), so please look around if you can't find it in your inbox.
